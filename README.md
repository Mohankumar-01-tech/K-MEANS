# README: K-Means Clustering

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for grouping similar data points into clusters. The `KMEANS.ipynb` notebook explores clustering techniques using real or synthetic datasets.

## Features
- Implementation of K-Means clustering algorithm.
- Visualization of clustered data points.
- Option to select the number of clusters (K).
- Uses distance metrics to assign points to clusters.
- Works with various datasets (e.g., 2D, high-dimensional data).

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for programming.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding.
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data processing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook KMEANS.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook cells step-by-step to preprocess data, apply K-Means clustering, and visualize results.
3. Adjust the number of clusters (K) to experiment with different clustering patterns.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Apply K-Means on **real-world datasets** (e.g., customer segmentation, image compression).
- Compare K-Means with other clustering techniques like **DBSCAN and Hierarchical Clustering**.
- Optimize algorithm efficiency for large datasets.
